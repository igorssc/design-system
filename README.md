Project developed in order to improve software development skills, especially focused on the solid consistency of standards during development, so that, in a future where the application may grow, there will be no inconsistencies of standards in development, nor difficulties in understanding the operation of components by teams of programmers.

The application began in a challenge proposed by the **Rocktseat Education** team, in order to pass on Design System concepts and the importance of their application in large projects or that may grow in the future.

The **Storybook** tool has been used, which aims to serve as an isolated environment for creating components.
